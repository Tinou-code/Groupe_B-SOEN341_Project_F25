Abderraouf El Khalil Karoun: When we first started as a group we tried to understand how to create the repository on the github. It was our first time doing so, therefore it took us some time.
Then, personally I did all the milestone for the duration of the project, which highlight each deadline for the sprints.
Then i got familiar with how do you reference a commit on github and i explained it to my teamate so we are all on the same basis. 
The total time would be 1h for the creation of the repository, then 15 minutes to do the milestone and 30 minutes to understand how to reference a commit and explained it to the group. Therefore, the total time is 1h45 minutes.
