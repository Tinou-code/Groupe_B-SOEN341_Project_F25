## Abderraouf El Khalil Karoun - 40315753 : When we started creating the repository, we worked together as a group since it was our first time using GitHub.

Afterward, I learned how to properly reference a commit and shared this knowledge with my teammate to ensure we were consistent. 
Overall, creating the repository took about one hour as a group to set everything up correctly and understand the process. Setting up the milestones required around 15 minutes,
