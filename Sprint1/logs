# Team Contribution Log

## Abderraouf El Khalil Karoun - 40315753 : When we started creating the repository, we worked together as a group since it was our first time using GitHub. 
I then took the lead on setting up the milestones required for the entire duration of the project, as well as for each sprint submission. 
Afterward, I learned how to properly reference a commit and shared this knowledge with my teammate to ensure we were consistent. 
Overall, creating the repository took about one hour as a group to set everything up correctly and understand the process. Setting up the milestones required around 15 minutes, 
while learning and explaining how to reference a commit took another 30 minutes, for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes

me complete the Minutes for our first meeting, taking about another 45 minutes.
