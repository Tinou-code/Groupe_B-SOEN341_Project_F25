Core Features 


3. Administrators
- Be able to approve organizer accounts.
- Moderate event listings for policy compliance.
- View global stats: number of events, tickets issued, and participation trends.
- Manage organizations and assign roles.
        - Other than just approving organization accounts, administrators can also:
              - Edit or update organization details (like their name, description, or logo).
              - Suspend or deactivate organizations if they’re not following the rules.
              - Remove organizations completely if needed.
              - Assign and manage roles within each organization.
- The roles we had in mind are:
             - Owner: Full control of the organization, including members and events.
             - Organizer: Can create and manage events, see attendance, and view analytics.
             - Staff/Moderator: Helps with events (like scanning tickets) but can’t edit or create events.
             - This setup gives administrators overall control, while organizations still have flexibility to run their own events.


4. Notification and Alert system
- Event reminders for students 
- Notify organizers when ticket sales are nearing capacity, when new attendees register or cancelled tickets
- Allow users to set how they wish to receive notifications (email, SMS)
